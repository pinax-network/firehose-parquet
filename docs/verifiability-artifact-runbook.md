# Verifiability Artifact Runbook

This runbook describes how to produce, publish, update, and consume verifiability artifacts for `firehose-parquet verify`.

It complements:

- `docs/verify-report-contract.md` for the JSON report schema contract
- `docs/verifiability-hash-strategy.md` for chain-aware hashing behavior

## Artifact Families

Two artifact families serve different purposes and should be operated separately.

### 1. Canonical Registry

Path:

- `/<chain>/mainnet/merkle_roots.parquet`

Purpose:

- Stores the canonical root registry used to compare computed partition roots.
- Represents the long-lived verification baseline for a chain/table dataset.

Operational properties:

- Mutable over time.
- Updated only by explicit verify runs.
- Should be retained longer than per-run reports.

### 2. Per-Run Reports

Path:

- `/<chain>/mainnet/verify_runs/<run_id>/report.json`

Purpose:

- Captures run-specific metadata and results for one verify execution.
- Provides an immutable audit trail for operational review, automation, and incident response.

Operational properties:

- Immutable after publication.
- Safe to publish with shorter retention than the canonical registry.
- Can be fan-out consumed by monitoring, reporting, or analytics systems.

## Recommended Lifecycle

### Local Run

1. Run `verify` against a local or S3-backed dataset.
2. Emit the human-readable terminal summary to stdout.
3. Optionally write `report.json` using `--report-json`.
4. Optionally publish the report to the suggested artifact path with `--publish-report`.
5. Optionally override the publish destination with `--publish-report-path`.
6. If roots are missing or intentionally updated, write `merkle_roots.parquet`.

### S3 Publication

For S3-backed operations:

1. Treat `merkle_roots.parquet` as the canonical mutable registry object.
2. Publish `report.json` under a unique `run_id` prefix, typically using `--publish-report`.
3. Do not overwrite an existing report path for the same `run_id`.
4. Keep registry lifecycle and report lifecycle policies independent.

## Root Registry Update Semantics

`merkle_roots.parquet` should follow these semantics:

- **Missing root**: safe to append/create as part of a verify run.
- **Mismatched root**: only overwrite when the operator explicitly intends to advance the canonical registry.
- **Algorithm change**: treat as a deliberate migration event, not a silent rewrite.

Recommended operator posture:

- Use missing-root fills as the normal onboarding path.
- Use root overwrites only with explicit operator intent and a preserved run report.
- Preserve the prior registry object version when object-store versioning is available.

## Immutability and Versioning Guidance

### Reports

- Reports should be immutable.
- Prefer object-store paths keyed by `run_id`.
- Do not republish different content to the same `run_id` path.

### Registry

- Registry content is mutable, but updates should be controlled.
- Prefer bucket versioning where available.
- Treat each write as a canonical state transition, not as ephemeral output.

## Publication Formats

### Required Today

- Human text summary to stdout
- JSON report file (`report.json`)
- Canonical registry parquet (`merkle_roots.parquet`)

### Optional / Future

- Summary parquet for fleet analytics
- Materialized text summaries stored alongside `report.json`

Current recommendation:

- Keep JSON as the primary machine-readable run artifact.
- Add summary parquet only when multi-run fleet analytics require it.

## S3 Operations Guidance

### Bucket Layout

Recommended layout:

- `s3://<bucket>/<chain>/mainnet/merkle_roots.parquet`
- `s3://<bucket>/<chain>/mainnet/verify_runs/<run_id>/report.json`

### Retention

- `verify_runs/`: shorter retention is acceptable.
- `merkle_roots.parquet`: longer retention is recommended.

### Versioning

- Enable bucket versioning when possible.
- This is especially valuable for `merkle_roots.parquet`, where overwrites reflect canonical-state changes.

### Metadata / Headers

Recommended S3 publication posture:

- Reports may use immutable cache semantics because paths are run-id scoped.
- Registry objects should avoid misleading long-lived immutable caching because the canonical object can change.

## Consumer Guidance

Consumers should:

- Read `report_schema_version` before parsing `report.json`.
- Treat `run_id` as the unique execution key.
- Use `registry_path` to identify the canonical registry consulted by the run.
- Use `suggested_run_report_path` as the publication target, not as proof that upload already happened.

Consumers should not:

- Treat `merkle_roots.parquet` as a run-history log.
- Assume every report was published to object storage.
- Infer canonical state from a single report alone.

## Testable Operational Checklist

### Local

- Run `verify` locally and confirm stdout summary renders expected metadata.
- Run with `--report-json` and confirm JSON includes run metadata and schema version.
- Run with `--publish-report` and confirm the report is written to the suggested run path.

### S3

- Run `verify` against an S3 path with explicit AWS configuration.
- Confirm registry reads/writes resolve correctly.
- Publish `report.json` to the suggested run path using `--publish-report`.
- Confirm lifecycle policies for `verify_runs/` and registry are configured independently.

## Suggested Team Policy

- Keep one canonical registry per chain/mainnet path.
- Publish one immutable report per run.
- Require a preserved run report for any canonical registry overwrite.
- Prefer docs-first contract changes before introducing new artifact formats.
